    "#### Introduction\n",
    "*Every news website classifies the news article before publishing it so that every time visitors visit their website can easily click on the type of news that interests them. Currently, the news articles are classified by hand by the content managers of news websites. But to save time, they can also implement a machine learning model on their websites that read the news headline or the content of the news and classifies the category of the news.*"

    "#### Text Classification\n",
    "*Text classification datasets are used to categorize natural language texts according to content. For example, think classifying news articles by topic, or classifying book reviews based on a positive or negative response. Text classification is also helpful for language detection, organizing customer feedback, and fraud detection.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*While this process is time consuming when done manually, it can be automated with machine learning models.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Category classification, for news, is a multi-label text classification problem. The goal is to assign one or more categories to a news article. A standard technique in multi-label text classification is to use a set of binary classifiers.*"
