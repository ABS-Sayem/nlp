       "'alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought alice “without pictures or conversations?” so she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. there was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself, “oh dear! oh dear! i shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\\nafter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. it was the white rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “oh! the duchess, the duchess! oh! won’t she be savage if i’ve kept her waiting!” alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “if you please, sir—” the rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go. alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “dear, dear! how queer everything is to-day! and yesterday things went on just as usual. i wonder if i’ve been changed in the night? let me think: was i the same when i got up this morning? i almost think i can remember feeling a little different. but if i’m not the same, the next question is, who in the world am i? ah, that’s the great puzzle!” and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\\nit was the white rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself “the duchess! the duchess! oh my dear paws! oh my fur and whiskers! she’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! where can i have dropped them, i wonder?” alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely. very soon the rabbit noticed alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, “why, mary ann, what are you doing out here? run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! quick, now!” and alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made. “he took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “how surprised he’ll be when he finds out who i am! but i’d better take him his fan and gloves—that is, if i can find them.” as she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name “w. rabbit,” engraved upon it. she went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real mary ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.\\nalice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head. “if i eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make some change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, i suppose.” so she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. as soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. the poor little lizard, bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood. “the first thing i’ve got to do,” said alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. i think that will be the best plan.” it sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry. an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “poor little thing!” said alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.\\nfirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. after these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. next came the guests, mostly kings and queens, and among them alice recognised the white rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. then followed the knave of hearts, carrying the king’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came the king and queen of hearts. alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a procession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn’t see it?” so she stood still where she was, and waited. when the procession came opposite to alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the queen said severely “who is this?” she said it to the knave of hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\\nthe king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the king was the white rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. in the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made alice quite hungry to look at them—“i wish they’d get the trial done,” she thought, “and hand round the refreshments!” but there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time. alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there. “that’s the judge,” she said to herself, “because of his great wig.” the judge, by the way, was the king; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\\nbut her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little alice and all her wonderful adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:— first, she dreamed of little alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister’s dream. the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by—the frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it—once more the shriek of the gryphon, the squeaking of the lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock turtle. \\nalice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell “stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “a nice muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought alice. one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. this of course, alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. she did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was bill, the lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate. “herald, read the accusation!” said the king. on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:\\nthey had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. she pitied him deeply. “what is his sorrow?” she asked the gryphon, and the gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “it’s all his fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. come on!” so they went up to the mock turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing. “this here young lady,” said the gryphon, “she wants for to know your history, she do.” “i’ll tell it her,” said the mock turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit down, both of you, and don’t speak a word till i’ve finished.” so they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. alice thought to herself, “i don’t see how he can ever finish, if he doesn’t begin.” but she waited patiently. “once,” said the mock turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “i was a real turtle.” these words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of “hjckrrh!” from the gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle. alice was very nearly getting up and saying, “thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could not help thinking there must be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.\\nwhen she got back to the cheshire cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the king, and the queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable. the moment alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said. the executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at his time of life. the king’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense. the queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in less than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.) alice could think of nothing else to say but “it belongs to the duchess: you’d better ask her about it.” “she’s in prison,” the queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.” and the executioner went off like an arrow. the cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.'"
