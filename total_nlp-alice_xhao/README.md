## Welcome to the Natural Language Processing in Python Tutorial!

We will be going through several Jupyter Notebooks during the tutorial and use a number of data science libraries along the way. The easiest way to get started is to download Visual Studio Code, which is free and open source. When you download this, it comes with the Jupyter  Notebook IDE and many popular data science libraries, so you donâ€™t have to install them one by one.

*In this tutorial we will go through with Data Cleaning, Exploratory data Analysis, Sentiment Analysis, Topic Modeling, Text Generation tasks.*
